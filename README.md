# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to help retrieve and visualize weather data for travel app, PlanMyTrip. This project will show a demo by choosing four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

## Deliverable

Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map

## Result

### Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data

Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data you gathered in this module, use your API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

The link is the result of performing an API call with the OpenWeatherMap and retrieving the current weather description of each city. [Weather_Data]( https://github.com/Monsaiaung/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/30bd592de561ffba13a3493c8317f88216aef244/Weather_Data/WeatherPy_Database.csv)
